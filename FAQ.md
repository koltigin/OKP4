# General Concepts
### What is the Nemeton Program?
> The Nemeton Program is OKP4 incentivized testnet. Any validator can apply for the Nemeton program by registering on the 'Join the program' form. Only 150 validators will be selected for phases 1 to 4 to become Druids, the official title for incentivized testnet participants. The phase 5 (by the end of the program) will open for developers to join though.
> During every phase from 1 to 5, Druids will have the opportunity to participate in the following:
> * Node-specific tasks (to test the network)
> * Community tasks (to let the world know about the network)
> * Participate in challenges (to contribute to and improve the network)
### Who are the druids in OKP4 ecosystem?
> The word « druid » corresponds to the name of the validators who participate in the incentivized testnet Nemeton Program, they are chosen by the OKP4 team.
### What does it mean to be an OKP4 Druid?
> The OKP4 blockchain is a Layer 1 PoS (proof of stake). 
> To secure its network, we need a set of validators called druids in the context of the Nemeton Program. 
> Druids are in charge of operating nodes to build, share, verify blocks to operate and secure the network. 
> They will have specific tasks given to them and can choose to perform them to earn points and climb the leaderbord.
### What is staking?
> Staking is immobilizing one's crypto-asset to participate in the blockchain consensus mechanism. 
> Staking rewards users who participate in the consensus (nodes) and the ones who delegate to nodes.
> In a PoS blockchain like OKP4, validators have a determined voting power thanks to the number of tokens they have staked and were delegated to them.

### Why 150 druids?
> We will choose only 150 druids for various reasons such as logistics, tokenomics, technical, internal resources reasons, etc.
> Community members who are not selected will have the opportunity to get involved and earn rewards during other stages of the network, so stay tuned.

# Phases, tasks, and rewards
### How many phases does the Nemeton program have?
> The Nemeton Program will be divided into 5 phases over several months, allowing for testing different aspects of OKP4. 
> Each phase will be punctuated by challenges and tasks to collect as many points as possible and compete in the leaderboard.
### How long does the program last?
> We can't give you a definite end date right now. However, we can tell you that the first 4 phases will last approximately one month each. Phase 5 will be longer because it is a step that concerns builders. 
> We can say that the Nemeton program will last six months, more or less, and anyone can perform the tasks he wants.
### What are the rewards associated with the Nemeton program
> During the program, there will be two types of ways to earn points:
> * Fixed points for specific tasks.
> * Pools of points to divide up for more creative tasks.
> Druids will be rewarded with a mix of token rewards and delegation commitment. 
> 1% of the total supply of mainnet tokens will be given to Nemeton participants as a reward based on their participation and performance during the program.
> Many more tokens (OKP4 foundation vesting) will be delegated to Druids who operate nodes on mainnet based on their participation and performance during the program.
