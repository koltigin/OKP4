# Privacy
> As part of the Testnet, you may be entrusted with so-called Confidential Information, which will be clearly identified and notified as such. Accordingly, you may not reveal, publish, or otherwise disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without OKP4's prior written consent, and you must protect the Confidential Information from disclosure using the same degree of care that you use to protect your own Confidential Information of the same nature, but in no event using less than reasonable care.

# Applicable Law
> These Terms and any action relating to them shall be governed by the laws of France, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes (defined below) shall be Toulouse, and you and OKP4 each waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue.

# Dispute Resolution
> Please read the following section carefully, as it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with OKP4 and limits the way you may obtain relief from us. No class or representative action or arbitration is permitted under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration prevents you from filing a lawsuit or having a trial with a judge.
> * Binding Arbitration of Disputes. We both agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of your participation in the Testnet, use of the OKP4 Services or these Terms or the breach, termination, performance, interpretation, or validity thereof (collectively, 'Disputes') shall be resolved solely by binding individual arbitration and not by any class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and OKP4 agree that the Chambre Arbitrale Internationale de Paris, France shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and OKP4 each waive the right to a trial by judge or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms.
> * Exceptions. As limited exceptions to the above section: (i) we may both seek to resolve a dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we both retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
> * Conduct of Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted by the Chambre Arbitrale Internationale de Paris ('CAIP') under its then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules ('CAIP Rules'), unless modified by these Terms. The CAIP Rules are available at https://www.arbitrage.org. A party wishing to initiate an arbitration must submit a written request for arbitration to CAIP and notify the other party as set forth in the CAIP Rules (Arbitration Rules: https://www.arbitrage.org/arbitrage/#REGLEMENT_ARBITRAGE). The place of arbitration shall be Toulouse. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all questions relating to the interpretation, applicability, performance, and scope of this arbitration agreement.
> * Arbitration Fees. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitration fees will be governed by the CAIP rules. If we prevail in the arbitration, we will seek, to a reasonable extent, considering the facts in dispute, to recover them from you. If you prevail in the arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs to the extent provided by applicable law.
> * Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided above, the arbitrator will determine all questions of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may grant declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief justified by that party's individual claim. To the extent that either you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (i.e., injunctive relief whose primary purpose and effect is to enjoin unlawful acts that threaten future harm to the public), the right to and extent of such relief shall be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not arbitrated. The parties agree that litigation of any public injunction issue shall be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration on the merits of any individual claim.
> * Waiver of Class Action; Waiver of Trial by Judge. You and OKP4 agree that each may bring Claims against the other only in your or his or her individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. In addition, if the parties' Dispute is resolved by arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's Claims with your Claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, this entire section on dispute resolution will be null and void. You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by a judge.
> * Severability. Except as provided above ('Class Action Waiver'), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of these Terms shall continue to apply.

# Assignment
> You may not sell, assign, or transfer any of your rights, duties, or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer of the Terms without such consent will be null and void. We reserve the right to assign or transfer these Terms or any of its rights, duties, and obligations hereunder to any third party. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

# General Terms
> Nothing herein shall constitute an employment, consulting, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and OKP4. If any provision of the Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements, and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The use of the word 'including' shall be construed to mean 'including and without limitation'.
> Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by the Company under the Terms, including those regarding changes to the Terms, may be given by posting on the OKP4 website, blog, or through other communications (such as forums, Telegram, Discord, or other channels).
> Waiver of Rights. OKP4's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. A waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of OKP4. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms shall be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
